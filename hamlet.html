        <page intro="">
            <p>Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo approach the prince, Hamlet. They tell him that they’ve seen what they think is the ghost of his father. Hamlet joins them that night on their watch and, behold! His father’s ghost appears. He tells Hamlet that he was murdered by his brother, Claudius, who then married his wife, Gertrude and took over the throne. He asks Hamlet to seek revenge. </p>

        <page madboy="">
            <p>The news and the sight of his father’s ghost were too much for Hamlet. He goes insane, confusing everyone around him with lunatic outbursts.
                Meanwhile, Polonius (Ophelia’s father), Claudius, and Gertrude form a plan to find out if the cause of Hamlet’s madness is love for Ophelia. They spy on Hamlet and Ophelia as Ophelia gives back the tokens of his affection.
                Hamlet is unfocused and doesn’t seem to pay attention to what Ophelia is saying to him. His reaction isn’t what they expected. They agree lovesickness must not be the cause.</p>

        <p> Then, a theatre troupe visits the castle. Gertrude and Claudius believe it might help Hamlet to watch them perform, but they have to have him dragged out when his outbursts continually interrupt the play.</p>
        <p> Hamlet is sent away as quickly as possible. Claudius sees his opportunity to get rid of Hamlet for good and takes it – Rosencrantz and Guildenstern accompany Hamlet with a letter calling for his death.</p>
        <p> Goodnight, sweet prince... </p>

        <p>Hamlet stabs Polonius and he falls over dead. Hamlet and Gertrude continue to argue, with Hamlet making less and less sense, until the ghost appears, reminding Hamlet that his mother shouldn’t be blamed and revenge should be sought against Claudius.</p>
        <p> The sight of the ghost sends Hamlet into a frenzy.  </p>

            How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
            (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
            To put an antic disposition on),

            With arms encumbered thus, or this headshake,
            Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
            As “Well, well, we know,” or “We could an if we would,”
            Or “If we list to speak,” or “There be an if they might,”
            Or such ambiguous giving out—to note
            That you know aught of me. This not to do,
            So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
            Swear.
            </i></p>
            <p>Hamlet begins his act of madness: scaring and ignoring Ophelia, confusing everyone around him with seemingly lunatic outbursts. A theatrical troupe visits the castle, and he plans for them to perform “The Murder of Gonzago,” a play that mirrors what happened to the late king, to get Claudius to betray the fact that he murdered King Hamlet. </p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Polonius (Ophelia’s father), Claudius, and Gertrude form a plan of their own to find out if the cause of Hamlet’s madness is love for Ophelia. They spy on Hamlet and Ophelia as Ophelia gives back the tokens of his affection. </p>
			<p><i> Hamlet:
            You should not have believed me, for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.</i></p>
            <p><i> Ophelia:
            I was the more deceived.</i> </p>
            <p><i> Hamlet:
            Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.</i></p>
            <p> They agree that lovesickness must not be the cause. </p>

        <page jailboy="">
        <p>Then, the play, enacting the perceived events of the king’s murder. Hamlet watches Claudius closely, and he does act strangely. When the king is killed, he demands light and flees, along with the rest of the audience. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern approach Hamlet – he’s wanted in his mother’s quarters.</p>
        <p>Polonius hides himself in Gertrude’s quarters before Hamlet barges in. They argue, and Hamlet gets a little too intense. His mother cries out, and Polonius yells for help. </p>
        <p><i>Hamlet:

        <p>Hamlet stabs Polonius and he falls over dead. Hamlet and Gertrude continue to argue until the ghost appears, reminding Hamlet that his mother shouldn’t be blamed and revenge should be sought against Claudius. Hamlet makes Gertrude promise not to tell anyone he’s faking being insane and leaves to hide the body. </p>
        <p> Once Polonius’ body is found, Hamlet is locked away. Hamlet is still perceived to be insane by everyone that sees him, except his mother. Gertrude keeps quiet about what Hamlet told her.</p>
        <p> Hamlet tries to explain things to Ophelia when she visits him, but she can’t forgive him for what he did. </p>
        <p> Since he now knows that Hamlet suspects him of killing his father, Claudius uses this opportunity to sentence Hamlet to death. No matter what Hamlet says about only pretending to be insane, no one speaks out against Claudius’ ruling.</p>
        <p>After Hamlet is killed, Laertes returns to Denmark to be with his grieving sister. His only regret is that he didn’t have the opportunity to kill Hamlet himself.</p>
        <p>Though Gertrude believed what Hamlet told her, time and grief drove her into Claudius’ arms again. He made her believe that Hamlet was truly mad and that nothing he said was true.</p>
        <p>Life goes on in Denmark, short of one brooding teen and his girlfriend’s father.</p>

            <p>Once Polonius’ body is found, Hamlet is sent to England with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Ophelia is driven mad with grief. Laertes makes his way back to Denmark, plunged into rage once he sees the state of his father and sister.</p>
			<p> <i> Ophelia:

            <p>The next day, Hamlet reveals to Horatio that he was supposed to be killed in England, but he switched the letter calling for his death with one calling for the death of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Hamlet is issued Laertes’ challenge.</p>
            <p>Hamlet asks Laertes for forgiveness before their duel, and Laertes says he can’t forgive Hamlet yet, but he can accept his love. </p>
